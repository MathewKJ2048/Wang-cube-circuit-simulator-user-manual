# View

The view controls are present at the bottom-right of the center pane. In order from left to right, the buttons do the following:

- `toggle grid` button - toggles the grid in the editor
- `reset view` button - resets the zoom to the default value and re-centres the editor
- `zoom in` and `zoom out` buttons - control the zoom of the editor

The zoom slider is synced to the zoom buttons.
