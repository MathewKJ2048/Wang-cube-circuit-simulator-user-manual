# Tile Editor

The tile editor is used to edit the picked token's name (core and classes), and, if the token is a tile type, its adjacency strings and color mapping. The mapping is edited using HTML5-color-pickers next to the text fields to edit the associated strings. The fields, from top to bottom, are:

- classes
- core
- up
- down
- left
- right
- front
- back

Edits are reflected in real time in the preview, which can be manipulated by clicking and dragging the mouse.
